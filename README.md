## Overview

### The challenge

- Create a Replica of the Results Summery page.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- A lot of divs
- A lot more CSS
- Flexbox Mainly
- CSS Grid For the layout
- Desktop-first workflow (Regretted it later)

### What I learned

```css
.circle {
  background-image: linear-gradient(
    0deg,
    hsla(241, 81%, 54%, 0.247) 39%,
    hsla(256, 72%, 46%, 1) 100%
  );
}
```

- I already knew linear gradient, but making one color more dominant than the other was new for me.

### Continued development

I will continue to look into different media queries because the transition between the 400px and 600px.
I made it the same as the mobile version, but i think there would be better approaches.

I also want to look more into @container, i saw this feature and it was amazing as a concept, but when i tried to use it on firefox, it didn't work. And after a whole hour learning it i found out it was not supported by most of the websitesðŸ˜€.

The same thing happened with customizing the scrollbar, but at least it was supported by chrome.
